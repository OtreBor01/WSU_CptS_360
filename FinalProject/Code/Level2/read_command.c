    Reads nbytes from an opened file descriptor into a buffer area in user space. The read system call is
    routed to the read function in the OS kernel.
    Preparations:
        ASSUME: file is opened for RD or RW;
        ask for a fd  and  nbytes to read;
        verify that fd is indeed opened for RD or RW;
        return(myread(fd, buf, nbytes));
