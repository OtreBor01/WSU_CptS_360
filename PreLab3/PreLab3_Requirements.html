<pre>             CS360 LAB#3 PreWork DUE: 2-14/15

NOTE: LAB#3 PreWork require you to turn in a harcopy of your code


1. Download samples/LAB3/mtx.tgz

   Run      zcat mtx.tgz | tar xvf -

   to extract files MTX1, MTX2, README, LAB3pre.bin

2. Run programs in MTX1 and MTX2, as shown and EXPLAINED in class.

3. Modify MTX2 to the following:

(1). char *myname = "YOUR_NAME";  // your name 

     Rewrite the body() function as 
             int body(char *myname){ printf("%s", myname);  .....  }
     Modify kfork() to do the following:

        When a new proc starts to execute body(), print the myname string,
             which should be YOUR name.

        When body() ends, e.g. by a null command string, retrun to do_exit();

  HINT: AS IF the proc has CALLED body(), passing myname as parameter.

(2). Modify kfork() to implement process family tree as a binary tree
       In the body() function, print the children list of the running proc.

(3). Implement  kexit(int exitValue):
       P1 never die;
       give away children, if any, to P1
       record exitValue in proc's exitCode;
       become a ZOMBIE;
       wakeup parent (by parent proc address);
       tswitch();

(4). Implement  int wait(int *status):
       return -1 for ERROR if no child;

       while(1){
          if (found a ZOMBIE child){
             copyt ZOMBIE child exitCode to *status;
             bury the ZOMBIE child (put into freeList as FREE);
             return ZOMBIE child pid;
          }
          sleep on OWN proc address;
        }

(5). Add a "wait" command and a do_wait() function to allow (running) proc to 
     wait for a ZOMBIE child; print the ZOMBIE child's pid and exit status.

 
4. DEMO your work on 2-14/15.

5. Sample solution: samples/LAB3/LAB3pre.bin
